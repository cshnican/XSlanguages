Sihan Chen, David Gil, Sergey Gaponov, Jana Reifegerste, Tessa Yuditha, Tatiana Tatarinova, Ljiljana Progovac, and Antonio Benitez-Burraco

This Github repository contains the data, the analysis script, and the figures in the paper.

## A description of the repository content

### Data
This folder contains the data used in our analysis:
- sociopolitical features from D-Place (Kirby et al., 2016): `{B014, EA031, EA033, EA202, SCCS150, SCCS156}.csv`
- database of 2000+ languages maintained by David Gil, containing each language's Glottocode (Hammarstr√∂m et al., 2022), family size from Glottocode, EGIDS value from Ethnologue (Eberhard et al., 2022), and the family each language belongs to according to Glottocode: `exotericity.csv`
- information of each language from WALS (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013), including their coordinates: `languages.csv`
- a collection of WALS features of each language: wals_compiled.csv
- a classification on whether each feature classification pertains to morphology, syntax, or a mixture of morphology and syntax, by Antonio Benitez-Burraco, David Gil, and Ljiljana Progovac: `LP WALS_test_final_morph_vs_syntax, LP+ABB.csv`
- (deprecated) phylogenical information of languages in the EDGE tree (Bouckaert et al., 2022), taken from Shcherbakova et al. (2023): `wrangled.tree`
- phylogenical information of languages in the EDGE tree (Bouckaert et al., 2022): `new.tree`
- resulting main tables to be used in our analysis: `compiled_table_20231010.csv, compiled_table_20231213_pca.csv`

### imgs
This folder contains the images generated:
- loading plot: `fig1.pdf`
- global analysis results: `fig2.pdf`
- controlled analysis results: `fig3.pdf`
- posterior means of the controlled analysis: `fig4.pdf`

### output_table
This folder contains the main results:
- global analysis results: `fixefs_pca_global.csv`
- controlled analysis results: `fixefs_pca.csv`

### scripts
This folder contained the scripts conducting the analysis. Since the analysis was carried out on a computational cluster, for each script `*.R`, there's a bash script `*.sh` to run it on the cluster. The script `run_all.sh` runs everything in order. Below is a description of the files in the order they should be executed:

- `make_table.R`: it takes in all the data in the data folder and generates a compiled table `compiled_table_20231010.csv`
- `impute_soc_data.R`: it imputes the missing values in societal features, conducts a principal component analysis, and appends the results to the compiled table. The new compiled table is `compiled_table_20231213_pca.csv`
- `prune_tree.R`: it loads the global phylogenic tree generated in Bouckeart et al. (2022) and takes the subset of languages in our database. The resulting tree is `new.tree`.
- `analysis_soc_linear_global.R` / `analysis_soc_logic_global.R`: they perform a simple linear regression / logistic regression (hence the global analysis) between grammatical classifications and the principal component. The results are stored in the folder `output_data_pca_global`. NOTE: the output files are too big to be included on Github, so neither the files nor the directory was in this repository.
- `analysis_soc_linear.R` / `analysis_soc_logic.R`: they perform a Bayesian mixed-effects linear regression / logistic regression (hence the controlled analysis) between grammatical classifications and the principal component, controlling for language relatedness and geographical proximity. The results are stored in the folder `output_data_pca`. NOTE: the output files are too big to be included on Github, so neither the files nor the directory was in this repository.
- `extract_fit_global.R` / `extract_fit.R`: they read output files from the analysis, compiled them, and generate figures. The figues are stored in the `imgs` folder.
- `extract_fit_detailed.R`: it generates the fitted values for each grammatical classifications, given the model. NOTE: the output files are too big and are not discussed in the main paper, but they would be stored at `imgs/detailed`.
